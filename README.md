# Hello Flutter - TODO list

An example Flutter application showing some basic concepts, including integration with the Firebase
platform:

- Firebase authentication
- Cloud Firestore database

## Getting Started

To launch the app, you need to provide the Firebase API settings in a firebase_options.dart file.
To get the file generated:
1. Go to Firebase and create a new project (if you don't have one available)
2. Inside the Firebase project enable:
   1. Authentication module
   2. Email authentication
   3. Anonymous authentication
   4. Cloud Firestore database
3. [Install FlutterFire CLI tool](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#setup_update_cli)
4. Inside the project's folder run `flutterfire configure` and choose appropriate Firebase project.
